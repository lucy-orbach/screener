<h1>Depression Screen</h1>
Responsive Web Application using React/Redux

<h2>Get Started</h2>
<p>Depression Screen is a Client-side application. You can choose to open it by downloading this repository and simply opening the index.html file on your browser. If you would like to inspect the react components, you can run it on a local server by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install Node 6.<br/>
    $nvm install -g node
  </li>
  <li>Clone this repository.<br />
  git clone https://github.com/lucy-orbach/screener.git
  </li>
  <li>Make sure you're in the directory you just created.<br /> 
      - cd /path/to_my_new_folder
  </li>
  <li>Install Node Packages.<br />
     - npm install
  </li>
  <li>Run the app.<br />
      - npm start <br />
      This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser.
  </li>
  <li>Install React developer tools in Chrome.</li>
